# Version control with Git

Git is a version control system. You can use Git on any folder to turn it into
a *repository* with version control. This means you can make changes in the folder and
*commit* them to a new version of that folder. If you later regret the changes, or want to figure out how that nasty bug got into your code, you can *check out* previous versions of the folder, en *revert* to them.

Git is a command line tool. Although a plethora of GUI-based applications for interaction with Git exist, in this tutorial we are going to stick with the command line interface, as it is the most universal way to interact with Git: it will even work on remote computers, like computational servers, over SSH.
