# Essential skills for medical image analysis

This repository contains a number of tutorials on essential skills for applying machine learning methods for medical image analysis.

The tutorials are still work in progress. Thus far, the following tutorials are implemented:
* [Python essentials](python-essentials.md)
* [Numerical and scientific computing in Python](scientific-computing.md)
* [Working with medical images in Python](medical-images.md)
* [Linux essentials](linux-essentials.md)

We are currently working on the following tutorials:
* Deep learning with Keras
* Code version control with Git

Some generic Python hints are written down [here](python-hints.md).
