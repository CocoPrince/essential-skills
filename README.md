# [Essential skills for medical image analysis](https://tueimage.github.io/essential-skills/)

This repository contains a number of tutorials on essential skills for applying machine learning methods for medical image analysis.

The tutorials are still work in progress. Thus far, the following tutorials are implemented:
* [Python essentials](python-essentials.md)
* [Numerical and scientific computing in Python](scientific-computing.md)
* [Working with medical images in Python](medical-images.md) (Under construction)
* [Linux essentials](linux-essentials.md)
* [Git essentials](version-control-with-git.md)

We are currently working on the following tutorial:
* Deep learning with Keras

Some generic Python hints are written down [here](python-hints.md).
